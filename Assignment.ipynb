    "Python's popularity as a programming language stems from several key features that make it appealing to both beginners and experienced developers:-\n",
    "1-Simple and Readable Syntax: Python's syntax is clean and easy to understand, resembling plain English. This simplicity reduces the learning curve and makes code easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Versatility: Python is a general-purpose language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. This flexibility allows it to be used in various fields, such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides tools and modules for a wide range of tasks, from file handling and regular expressions to web services and data manipulation. This reduces the need to write code from scratch for common tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Large and Active Community: Python has a vast and supportive community of developers. This means abundant resources, such as tutorials, documentation, forums, and third-party libraries, making it easier to find help and expand the language’s functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "5-Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python is platform-independent, meaning it can run on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux without requiring modification. This portability is crucial for developing applications that need to work on multiple platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features combine to make Python a versatile, powerful, and accessible language, contributing to its widespread adoption across various industries and applications."

    "Python provides several types of loops for iterating over data or executing a block of code repeatedly. Here’s a breakdown of the main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 -  for Loop\n",
    "     The for loop is used to iterate over elements of a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or any iterable object.\n",
    "2 - while Loop\n",
    "    The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.\n",
    "3 - break Statement\n",
    "    The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely.\n",
    "4 - continue Statement\n",
    "    The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration."
